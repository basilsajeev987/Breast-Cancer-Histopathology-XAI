# Breast Cancer Histopathology Classification Using Explainable Transfer Learning

## Overview

This project presents a deep learning framework for automated breast cancer histopathology image classification using transfer learning and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI).

Five state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks were evaluated:

* DenseNet121
* ResNet50
* EfficientNetB0
* VGG16
* MobileNetV2

The best-performing model was further analyzed using Grad-CAM to provide visual explanations of model predictions.

## Objectives

* Develop an automated breast cancer classification system.
* Compare multiple transfer learning architectures.
* Evaluate model performance using comprehensive classification metrics.
* Improve interpretability using Grad-CAM visualizations.
* Ensure reproducibility through patient-level stratified splitting.

---

## Dataset

### BreakHis Dataset

The project uses the BreakHis (Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification) dataset.

Characteristics:

* 7,909 histopathology images
* 82 patients
* Benign and Malignant classes
* Magnifications: 40X, 100X, 200X, 400X

Dataset is not included in this repository due to licensing and size limitations.

---

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation

A patient-level stratified split was performed to:

* Prevent patient data leakage
* Maintain class balance across splits

Dataset partitions:

* Training Set
* Validation Set
* Test Set

### 2. Transfer Learning

Pretrained ImageNet models were used as feature extractors.

Each architecture was modified with:

* Global Average Pooling
* Dropout Layer
* Binary Classification Output Layer

### 3. Model Evaluation

The following metrics were used:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
* ROC-AUC
* Confusion Matrix

### 4. Explainable AI

Grad-CAM was used to visualize image regions contributing most strongly to predictions.
